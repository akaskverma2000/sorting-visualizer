## Title:
Sorting Visualizer

## Description:

This project provides a visual representation of different sorting algorithms, allowing you to see how they work in real-time. Algorithms currently implemented include:

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Quick Sort (optional)

## Features:

* Visualizes the sorting process by drawing rectangles for each element in the array.
* Highlights the compared elements during swaps and shifts.
* Allows user to choose the sorting algorithm to visualize.

## Getting Started:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akaskverma2000/sorting-visualizer.git
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   The project requires a graphics library like BGI (Borland Graphics Interface) or a similar framework. You might need to install the appropriate libraries based on your development environment.

3. **Build the project:**

   The build process depends on your chosen build system. Refer to the comments in the `main.cpp` file for guidance on the specific command. (e.g., `make` for Makefile, `cmake --build .` for CMake)

4. **Run the program:**

   Once built, you can run the program from the command line:

   ```bash
   ./your_program_name  # Replace with the actual executable name
   ```

##  Using the program:

The program will display a menu of available sorting algorithms. Choose the desired algorithm to visualize the sorting process.

## Technologies:

* C++ Programming Language
* Graphics library (e.g., BGI)
